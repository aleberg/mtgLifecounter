# mtg-lifecounter
Arduino-based 'Magic: The Gathering' D20 dice roller and two player life counter.

Random number generator uses https://code.google.com/archive/p/avr-hardware-random-number-generation/. 

See the partslist for a basic BOM. The case I used is a TEKO 102.9 - the front panel design fits it and the 7 segment displays I used (vqe 23).
